        <p>Due to the sudden closings and breaks of establishments throughout the year, many individuals were not able to prepare themselves for financial loss. Thus, donations help labor unions and non-profits give back to workers that have experienced hardships due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We also encourage donating towards those in underprivleged areas so that they have an opportunity to get back on their feet!</p>

        <p>Take the opportunity to write to your state senator or representative! Writing about the cause will help raise awareness on the effects of wealth inequality and how it has been affecting people's lives on a personal level. It will also encourage the government to implement new policies or improved programs to reduce the gap. If you're able to, also be sure to register to vote and support candidates that will fight for you!</p>
