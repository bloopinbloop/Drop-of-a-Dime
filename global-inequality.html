    <h2 class="globalHeading">Global Inequality</h2>

    <p class="globalDesc">Wealth inequality is an issue occuring around the world; however, the gap in which it is happening varies from country to country. Many people often assume that the most developed countries are bound to have the least amount of imbalance due to the idea that those nations would be more progressive and for the people. <strong> Unfortunately, this is not the case. </strong> <br> For example, the United States of America is ranked 17 out of 189 countries in terms of development; yet, they are ranked 54th when it comes to having the highest wealth inequality. So, let's compare America with a few other developed nations.</p>

      <div class="countryInfo">
        <h4>Sweden</h4>
        <p>Sweden is 7th for being the world's most developed nation and ranks 156 out of 174 for most wealth inequality. One reason of why the imbalance is low is because of their union participation. Approximately 82% of Sweden's population accounts for union workers. Therefore, the people are able to have more influence over decisions, such as work wages and work regulations.</p>

      <div class="countryInfo">
        <h4>Hong Kong, China</h4>
        <p>Hong Kong stands at 4th for the world's most developed nation. Despite this position, the nation ranks 8th out of 174 for having the most wealth inequality. A reason that this is occuring is because of the rising prices of rent and property, which have forced many low-income families to move out of their homes. Moreover, wages are not increasing as fast as the inflation in the area.</p>

      <div class="countryInfo">
        <h4>Canada</h4>
        <p>Canada places at 16th as the world's most developed nation and  ranks 128 out 174 for most wealth inequality. A reason why Canada has less imbalance is due to the universal healthcare system. People without this system are less likely to have insurance because of its high costs. This means that universal healthcare allows for more accessibility for low-income families. </p>
