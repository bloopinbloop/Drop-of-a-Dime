      <h3>Our Mission</h3>
      <p>As the wage gap persists due to gender, race, and ethnicity, minimum wage remains stagnant in many states in America. Despite this, inflation of prices continues, thus resulting in higher costs of living. Due to inflation, the middle and lower class also struggle with achieving needed supplies against disasters, such as COVID-19. Moreover, people in poor communities often experience the adverse effects of climate change and pollution because their areas are not likely to receive the same funding and resources found in rich communities. With funding and resources in mind, it is also important to note that poor communities are not able to receive the same quality of education and opportunities as their rich counterparts.

      A person's background or area they were born into should not be the reason why their financial sucess is out of reach. So, we hope to give underprivleged communities the support they deserve by raising awareness, helping labor unions, and writing to policymakers. </p>
